      <h3 id="section-AboutMe">About Me</h3>
      <div>
        <p class = "teal">I graduated from The University of Manchester with a bachelor’s degree in Chemical Engineering in 2017 and subsequently 
          landed a job at Pakistan Refinery Limited (PRL) where I worked for nearly three years in the Commercial Department in a business and 
          strategizing-oriented role where I gained invaluable experience of the commercial elements of a manufacturing process. 
          Currently, I am seeking to make a switch to the Software/Tech industry in order to seek employment in industries that are closer 
          to my true passions such as; motorsports, videogames and innovative technology.</p>

        <p class = "teal">I have religiously followed Formula 1 for over a decade and for years it has been my “dream job” to work on the 
            development of a Formula 1 car - which involves rigorous testing and performance simulation. In an attempt to save every 
            thousandth of a second of lap time; high-tech simulators that model aerodynamic and engine capabilities are used back at the 
            factory in order to test the car virtually and improve on its performance. Additionally, race-winning decisions are made based on the results 
            generated by race strategy programs that process live data received from F1 cars in real-time and deduce the optimum pit stop strategy for the driver. 
            The aforementioned tools are created and made increasingly more accurate and effective by software developers. </p>
              
            <p class = "teal">Furthermore, from a young age having often spent several hours deeply engrossed in playing videogames in various formats, 
            I have always been extremely fascinated, not least in how pressing the “X” button on my controller causes my playable character 
            to jump on the screen; but equally by the development process involved in creating the incredibly expansive and elaborate worlds that the 
            character seemingly comes to life in. To put it briefly: it all boils down to Programming. In some cases, the Programming Languages used are 
            C++ (Unreal Engine) or C# (Unity) and JavaScript, while in other cases Python itself is sufficient to produce a simple videogame. The legendary 
            game director Mr. Hideo Kojima is one of my biggest creative inspirations and has greatly impacted my desire to not only develop a videogame, but 
            to also get involved with the story writing for one at some point in future. This creativity is not only limited to videogames, anime, animation etc. 
            but it also spills over to brainstorming ideas for unique and attractive applications for cellphones and computers on a daily basis.</p>
          
          <p class = "teal">Resultantly, I am now studying towards my Master of Sciences in Software Development (MSSD) at the prestigious 
          Boston University in order to acquire the skills that would enable me to bring my dreams into a reality.</p>
