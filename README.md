# CS601-Term_Project
My term project includes 5 pages plus two external links to my SoundCloud and GitHub
The index.html page is simply a basic portfolio that talks about me, my education, work experience etc.
The hobbies page and My Growth page include vue.js to allow for images to change by bringing the mouse over them
My Contact Form is a simple form that has conditions on each textbox and will not allow submission until those are met
I did not include an actual hosting or post link that actually sends the form info to me
Unfortunately I could not spend much time stylizing the project beyond whatever CSS i had done in the assignments due \
to lack of time.
